# Dibbr Privacy Policy

Dibbr uses the last few chat lines for context when chatting with other users. This data is never saved to disk. No logs are kept.
Data is not sent to third parties, with the exception of generating a response, where the last few lines of chat are sent to OpenAI's GPT.
If you wish to have your chat data excluded, please contact dabbr on discord, open a ticket here, or email tim@dabbr.com
